📝 File name to write this identity to: age-yubikey-identity-redacted?.txt

✅ Done! This YubiKey identity is ready to go.

🔑 Here's your shiny new Yubico USB peripheral identity: (gitleaks doesn't like the K word =)  )
  age1yubikey1qfwmheguzsuma4n9dq2vknkkh28d4vcnmvrv82gtzd6gf2scnel45wnnz44

Here are some example things you can do with it:

- Encrypt a file to this identity:
  $ cat foo.txt | age -r age1yubikey1qfwmheguzsuma4n9dq2vknkkh28d4vcnmvrv82gtzd6gf2scnel45wnnz44 -o foo.txt.age

- Decrypt a file with this identity:
  $ cat foo.txt.age | age -d -i age-yubikey-identity-redacted?.txt > foo.txt

- Recreate the identity file:
  $ age-plugin-yubikey -i --serial REDACTED --slot 1 > age-yubikey-identity-redacted?.txt

- Recreate the recipient:
  $ age-plugin-yubikey -l --serial REDACTED --slot 1

💭 Remember: everything breaks, have a backup plan for when this YubiKey does.
