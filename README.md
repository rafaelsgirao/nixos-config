# NixOS Configuration

This repository is home to the nix code that builds my NixOS systems.

## Why NixOS?

NixOS offers a unique, declarative approach to system configuration and package management, ensuring reproducibility and eliminating "works on my machine" issues. Its atomic upgrades and rollbacks provide a reliable and consistent environment, making system maintenance and troubleshooting simpler than alternative provisioning tools.

This flake makes use of [flake.parts](https://flake.parts).


## Acknowledgements
Huge thanks to my friends and other folks who maintain their own configurations, from where I've taken (and still take!) inspiration for building mine.
